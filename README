This repository includes my rc.lua, my theme.lua and vicious and obvious widgets (mostly default, with some tweaks).

To install, rename your ~/.config/awesome/ to ~/.config/awesome.backup/ or the like,  clone this repository into ~/.config/ then restart awesome.

If you wish to change the wallpaper, simply change the target of the symlink in the assets directory with `ln -s your_image ~/.config/awesome/themes/luigiitheme/assets/wallpaper'

The default editor for this setup is emacs and the default terminal is urxvtc (i.e. urxvtd must be running).

It uses the mintsstrong font, found in the artwiz-fonts package in Arch Linux. For other distros and OSes, check your repositories, or download from http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net/

The theme is based on the zenburn theme provided with awesome, originally by anrxc
