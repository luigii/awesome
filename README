This repository includes my rc.lua, my theme.lua and vicious and obvious widgets (mostly default, with some tweaks).

To install, rename your ~/.config/awesome/ to ~/.config/awesome.backup/ or the like,  clone this repository into ~/.config/ then restart awesome.

If you wish to change the wallpaper, simply change the target of the symlink in the assets directory with `ln -s your_image ~/.config/awesome/themes/luigiitheme/assets/wallpaper'

The default editor for this setup is emacs and the default terminal is urxvtc (i.e. urxvtd must be running).

The theme is based on the zenburn theme provided with awesome, originally by anrxc
